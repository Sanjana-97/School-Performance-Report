# School Performance Report with Power BI

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the use of **Power BI** to analyze and visualize the performance of School. The focus was on leveraging Power BI for data modeling, DAX calculations, and creating interactive dashboards to extract meaningful insights from the data. The project provides a comprehensive analysis of:
- Student performance.
- Faculty contributions.
- Key management metrics such as revenue, profit, and withdrawals.

## Key Highlights

### 1. **Data Modeling**
- Built a robust data model using Power BIâ€™s Model View.
- Connected tables like Students, Faculty, Attendance, and Feedback.
- Created relationships to enable seamless filtering and analysis.

### 2. **Data Preparation**
- Used Power Query for data cleaning and transformation:
  - Removed duplicates and standardized column names.
  - Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.

### 3. **DAX Measures and Calculated Columns**
- Created custom measures and columns for enhanced insights:
  - **Attendance Percentage**: Average attendance across modules.
  - **Average Marks**: Aggregated student performance.
  - **Profit Calculation**: Revenue minus expenditures.
  - **Feedback Metrics**: Average faculty ratings.
  - **Competency Status**: Calculated column to classify students based on performance.

### 4. **Interactive Dashboards**
- Designed three visually rich and interactive dashboards:
  - **Student Report**: Tracks attendance, marks, and competency status for individual students.
  - **Faculty Report**: Monitors feedback scores, student outcomes, and module-wise performance.
  - **Management Report**: Highlights financial trends, demographics, and withdrawal reasons.
